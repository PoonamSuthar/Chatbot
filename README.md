# Chatbot
# Simple Chatbot in PHP

This is a simple chatbot implementation using PHP and AJAX. It allows users to interact with the chatbot by sending messages and receiving responses.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for chatbot interaction
- Javascript for seamless communication between the frontend and backend
- Randomized replies from the chatbot to simulate a conversation
- Simple implementation without the need for a database or complex logic

## Prerequisites

To run this chatbot project, you need to have the following installed on your local machine:

- Web server with PHP support (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP)
- Web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Copy the project files to your web server's document root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
3. Start your web server to make the files accessible via a local URL.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL where the project is located (e.g., `http://localhost/chatbot`).
5. You should see the chatbot interface in your browser.

## Usage

- Type your message in the input field and press Enter or click the Send button.
- The chatbot will generate a random response and display it in the conversation area.
- Continue the conversation by sending more messages and receiving replies from the chatbot.
- The chat history will be displayed in the conversation area, with your messages on the right and the chatbot's replies on the left.

## Customization

You can customize the chatbot's replies and add more features by modifying the PHP script (`message.php`) and the frontend HTML (`index.html`) and CSS (`style.css`) files.
